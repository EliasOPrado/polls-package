## Django-polls

Is a simple app that has the functionality to simulate votes.

Therefore, the repository has a package used to create the `polls` app within 
the ```mysite``` project. 

[Follow this tutorial to understand the package installation.](./django-polls/README.rst)


1. To install the package, use pip (you already installed it, right?):

```python -m pip install --user django-polls/dist/django-polls-0.1.tar.gz```
2. With luck, your Django project should now work correctly again. Run the server again to confirm this.

3. To uninstall the package, use pip:

```python -m pip uninstall django-polls```
